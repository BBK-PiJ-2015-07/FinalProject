#MSc Computer Science Final Project 
- Implementation of Sparse Markov Transducers ( https://noble.gs.washington.edu/papers/smt.pdf ) for establishing a baseline for normal system behaviour and classification of previously unseen call traces. The SMT forms part of the Decision Engine module of a basic  "proof of concept" host-based intrusion detection app. (ADFA datasets: https://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/australian-centre-for-cyber-security/cybersecurity/ADFA-IDS-Datasets/)
